PHP Template Inheritance (PHPTI)
================================

Template Inheritance is an extremely useful technique for making reusable HTML
layouts for a site. It is much more flexible than alternative techniques, such
as "including" common elements of a page (like a header and footer file).

The concept has been around for a while, most notably in the
[Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) template engine. Unlike other libraries,
*PHP Template Inheritance* lets you write everything in straight PHP. There is no
need to learn another template language.
